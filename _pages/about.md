I'm a Mechanical Engineering Masters student in the <a href="https://sbel.wisc.edu/">Simulation-Based Engineering Laboratory (SBEL)</a> at UW-Madison and I am advised by  [Prof. Dan Negrut](https://sbel.wisc.edu/negrut-dan/). My research interests include computational imaging, physically based rendering, robotics and machine learning. I'm interested in developing novel unconventional imaging systems for real-world applications such as robotics. I am also a lead developer of the ray tracing engine [Chrono::Sensor](https://api.projectchrono.org/sensor_overview.html) used for sensor simulations in robotics applications; it is also part of the multi-physics engine [Project Chrono](https://projectchrono.org/). You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AJRAoZCiUPHdYA3C89TVQCFVBqdZ_QAH/view?usp=drive_link)
