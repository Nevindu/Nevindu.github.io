My research interests include computational imaging, physically based rendering, robotics and machine learning. I’m interested in developing novel unconventional imaging systems for real-world applications such as robotics. I am also a lead developer of the ray tracing engine <a href="https://api.projectchrono.org/sensor_overview.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Chrono::Sensor</a> used for sensor simulations in robotics applications; it is also part of the multi-physics engine <a href="https://projectchrono.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Project Chrono</a>.
